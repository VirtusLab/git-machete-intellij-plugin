# Development

## Prerequisites

### IntelliJ

Use IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition/Ultimate.

1. (optional) Set up a shortcut for `Plugins` setting, you'll need to access it pretty often.
   Open `Search Actions` dialog with Ctrl+Shift+A (⌘⇧A on Mac),
   type `plugins`, press Alt+Enter (⌥↩ on Mac), then press the chosen shortcut (suggested: Ctrl+Alt+Shift+P, or ⌘⌥⇧P on Mac).

2. Make sure the following bundled plugins are enabled:
   * Git
   * Gradle
   * IntelliLang (for highlighting of language injections, e.g. JavaScript within Scala, or shell script within YAML)
   * Java Internationalization
   * JUnit
   * Lombok
   * Markdown
   * Plugin DevKit
   * Properties
   * Shell Script (also: agree to enable Shellcheck when asked)
   * YAML

3. (optional) If working on IntelliJ Ultimate, enable JavaScript and TypeScript plugin (for UI tests).

4. (optional) Install the following non-bundled plugins from Marketplace:
   * [Grammar-Kit IntelliJ plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6606-grammar-kit) can be used instead of Gradle plugin
     to manually generate grammar and lexer code from `.bnf` and `.flex` files.
   * [HOCON plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10481-hocon) for `.conf` file support in UI tests
   * [Kotlin plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6954-kotlin) will be useful for editing certain parts of UI, esp. dialogs.
   * [PsiViewer IntelliJ plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/227-psiviewer) can be helpful to see parsing result on the `machete` file
     when running IntelliJ instance with the Git Machete plugin loaded.
   * [Scala plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1347-scala) might be useful for editing UI tests.

5. Enable annotation processing (for Lombok):
   `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Annotation Processors > Enable Annotation Processing`.
   Select `Obtain annotation processors from classpath` radio box.

6. Set Project SDK to JDK 11: `Project Structure > Project`

7. Consider increasing maximum heap size for the IDE (the default value is 2048 MB) under `Help > Change Memory Settings`.

8. For running `./gradlew` from the command line, make sure that `java` and `javac` are in `PATH` and point to Java 11.

### Git config/hooks

From the main project folder, run the following commands:

```
git config --local include.path ../.gitconfig
ln -s ../../scripts/git-hooks/machete-pre-rebase .git/hooks/machete-pre-rebase
ln -s ../../scripts/git-hooks/machete-status-branch .git/hooks/machete-status-branch
ln -s ../../scripts/git-hooks/post-commit .git/hooks/post-commit
ln -s ../../scripts/run-pre-build-checks .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

#### Windows
**The hooks do not work on Windows** (however their execution seems to be possible theoretically).
This is because one may not be emulating bash environment in any way or doing it in some specific way.

#### macOS
Some hooks use `grep`. The macOS version of `grep` (FreeBSD) differs from GNU `grep`.
In order to make `grep` and eventually the hooks working one must:
1. Install `grep` via `brew` (it will not override system's `grep` - it can be executed as `ggrep`)
2. Run `brew ls -v grep`; among the other a path like should be found `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/grep/3.7/libexec/gnubin/grep`
3. Prepend the found path without `/grep` suffix to `PATH` (`/opt/homebrew/Cellar/grep/3.7/libexec/gnubin` in that case).
You may want to add the following `PATH="/opt/homebrew/Cellar/grep/3.7/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"` to (`.zprofile`/`.zshrc`)

Also, some issues with `bash` itself has been reported. Make sure that the version you are using is 5.1 or later.

### (optional) Windows

Building this project on Windows has been tested under [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/).

Additional setup:
1. Open the Registry Editor (`regedit.exe`).
2. Open path by clicking: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem`.
3. Find key named: `LongPathsEnabled` and double click.
4. If the data value is 0, change it to 1.


## Build

To build the project, run `./gradlew build`.

Currently, very generous maximum heap size options are applied for Gradle's Java compilation tasks (search for `-Xmx` in [build.gradle](build.gradle)). <br/>
To overwrite them, use `compileJavaJvmArgs` Gradle project property
(e.g. `./gradlew -PcompileJavaJvmArgs='-Xmx2g -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError' build`,
or equivalently with an env var: `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_compileJavaJvmArgs='-Xmx2g -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError' ./gradlew build`).

By default, Lombok's annotation processor runs on the fly and Delomboked sources are **not** saved to <subproject>/build/delombok/...<br/>
To enable Delombok, set `useDelombok` Gradle project property (e.g. `./gradlew -PuseDelombok build`).

Local (non-CI) builds by default skip most of [Checker Framework's](https://checkerframework.org/manual/) checkers to speed up Java compilation.<br/>
To make local builds more aligned with CI builds (at the expense of ~2x longer compilation from scratch),
set `runAllCheckers` Gradle project property (e.g. `./gradlew -PrunAllCheckers build`).

In case of spurious cache-related issues with Gradle build, try one of the following:
* `./gradlew --stop` to shut down gradle daemon
* `./gradlew clean` and re-run the failing `./gradlew` command with `--no-build-cache`
* remove .gradle/ directory in the project directory
* remove ~/.gradle/caches/ (or even the entire ~/.gradle/) directory


## Run & debug

To run an instance of IDE with Git Machete IntelliJ Plugin installed from the current source,
execute `:runIde` Gradle task (`Gradle panel > Tasks > intellij > runIde` or `./gradlew runIde`).

To watch the logs of this IntelliJ instance, run `tail -f build/idea-sandbox/system/log/idea.log`.


## Run UI tests

```
./gradlew [-Pagainst=<e.g. 2021.2>] [-Pheadless] [-Ptests=<e.g. toggle>] uiTest
```

See [Robot plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-ui-test-robot)
and [a preso on testing UI of IntelliJ Plugins](https://slides.com/plipski/intellij-plugin-ui-testing) for more details.


## Check dependency updates

`./gradlew dependencyUpdates`


## Generate and/or install snapshot build of the plugin

To generate a plugin archive (zip), run `:buildPlugin` Gradle task (`Gradle panel > Tasks > intellij > buildPlugin` or `./gradlew buildPlugin`).<br/>
The resulting file will be available under `build/distributions/`. <br/>
Alternatively, download the plugin zip from the artifacts of the given build
in [CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/VirtusLab/git-machete-intellij-plugin).

In either case (locally-built or CI-built), the zip can be installed via `File > Settings > Plugins > (gear icon) > Install Plugin from Disk...`.
Select the zip and restart the IDE.


## Logging

By default, IntelliJ logs everything with level `INFO` and above into `idea.log` file. <br/>
The exact location depends on a specific IntelliJ installation; check `Help > Show Log in Files` to find out. <br/>
Tip: use `tail -f` to watch the log file as it grows.

To enable logging of this plugin in `DEBUG` level, add `com.virtuslab` category to list in `Help > Diagnostic Tools > Debug Log Settings`. <br/>
A relatively small amount of `TRACE`-level logs is generated as well (`com.virtuslab:trace` to enable).


## Coding conventions

Most non-standard/project-specific conventions are enforced by:

* [pre-commit hook](scripts/run-pre-build-checks)
* [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/master/plugin-gradle) for Java code formatting
  (see [Eclipse-compatible config](config/spotless/formatting-rules.xml))
* [Checkstyle](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/) for code style/detecting basic smells
  (see the [config](config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml))
* [ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org/userguide/html/000_Index.html) for forbidden method calls/class naming patterns etc.
  (see [tests in top-level project](src/test/java/com/virtuslab/archunit))
* [Checker Framework](https://checkerframework.org/manual/) for formal correctness, esp. wrt. null safety and UI thread handling
  (most config in [build.gradle](build.gradle), stubs in [config/checker/](config/checker))

Other coding conventions include:

* Don't write nullary lambdas in `receiver::method` notation, use explicit `() -> receiver.method()` notation instead. <br/>
  `::` notation is confusing when applied to parameterless lambdas, as it suggests a unary lambda.
* Use `get...` method names for pure methods that only return the value without doing any heavy workload like accessing git repository. <br/>
  Use `derive...` method names for methods that actually compute their result and/or can return a different value every time when accessed.
* Non-obvious method params that have values like `false`, `true`, `0`, `1`, `null`, `""` should be preceded with a `/* comment */ `
  containing the name of the param.
* Avoid running code outside IDE-managed threads.
  Use either UI thread (for lightweight operations) or `Task.Backgroundable` (for heavyweight operations).

## UI conventions

So far created UI conventions:

* Add `...`  at the end of an action name if it is not executed immediately after clicking e.g. `Sync to Parent by Rebase...` (after this operation the interactive rebase window opens)
* Toolbar name texts of a **toolbar** actions that refer to a branch should indicate the branch under action with the word `Current`.
  On the other hand, **context-menu** actions text names should be kept short (no `This`/`Selected`).

## Rebuild the CI base image

To push the rebuilt image, you need write access to [`gitmachete` organization on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/gitmachete).

```
docker build -t gitmachete/intellij-plugin-ci:SEMANTIC-VERSION - < Dockerfile
docker push gitmachete/intellij-plugin-ci:SEMANTIC-VERSION
```


## Versioning

We follow [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for the plugin releases:

* MAJOR version must be bumped for each plugin release that stops supporting any IDEA build (typically when `sinceBuild` is increased). <br/>
  This does not apply to 0->1 major version transition, which is going to happen when the plugin's compatibility range is considered stable.
* MINOR version must be bumped for each plugin release that either adds a new user-facing feature
  or starts supporting a new quarterly (`year.number`) IDEA build (typically when `untilBuild` is increased).
* PATCH version must be bumped for each plugin release that adds no new user-facing features
  and doesn't change the range of supported IDEA builds.

### Sample sequence of versions between releases

After a release e.g. `1.0.3`, subsequent PRs merged to `develop` might change `PROSPECTIVE_RELEASE_VERSION`
in [version.gradle](version.gradle) in the following way:
1. `1.0.4` (bugfix PR)  - the first PR merged to develop after the release must bump `PROSPECTIVE_RELEASE_VERSION` since of course the prospective release won't be `1.0.3` anymore
1. `1.0.4` (bugfix PR)  - even if a new set of patch-level changes has been added on the PR, the released version is still going to be `1.0.4` (not `1.0.5`)
1. `1.1.0` (feature PR) - since we've just added a new feature, the new release won't be a PATCH-level anymore, but MINOR-level one
1. `1.1.0` (bugfix PR)  - even if a new feature has been added on the PR, the released version is still going to be `1.1.0` (not `1.2.0`)
1. `2.0.0` (breaking change PR)
1. `2.0.0` (feature PR) - again, still `2.0.0` and not e.g. `2.1.0`
1. `2.0.0` (bugfix PR)
1. `2.0.0` (release PR) - finally releasing as a major release; as a consequence, `1.0.4` and `1.1.0` never actually gets released

### IDE supported versions

Since we cannot skip `untilBuild` field in a plugin build configuration
(see related [issue](https://github.com/VirtusLab/git-machete-intellij-plugin/issues/460)
and [YouTrack ticket](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IJSDK-888)),
the most reasonable approach is to bump `untilBuild` to `X.*` when the new `X` EAP or RC version is released.

Once stable (non-EAP/RC) `X` is released, we should verify ASAP that our plugin is compatible with `X`.
There is a rather little risk that the plugin which is compatible with `X - 1`
and does **not** use any `X EAP/RC`-specific API
turns out to be **not** compatible with stable `X` release of IDE.

For instance:
1. our plugin in version `0.7.0` is compatible with IntelliJ `2020.2`
2. then IntelliJ `2020.3-EAP` is released (see [snapshot repository](https://www.jetbrains.com/intellij-repository/snapshots/) -> Ctrl+F `idea`)
3. we check if `0.7.0` is compatible with IntelliJ `2020.3-EAP`:
   set `ext.intellijVersions.eapOfLatestSupportedMajor` in [build.gradle](build.gradle)
   and see if the CI pipeline passes (this will both check binary compatibility and run UI tests against the given EAP)
4. we release the plugin as `0.8.0` (`untilBuild` will extend automatically to `2020.3.*`
   via `ext.intellijVersions.latestSupportedMajor` in [build.gradle](build.gradle))
5. once the stable `2020.3` is released, we verify ASAP that `0.8.0` is binary compatible with `2020.3` as well;
   then, `latestStable` can be updated to `2020.3`, `eapOfLatestSupportedMajor` can be set to `null`,
   and `2020.2.x` can be added to `latestMinorsOfOldSupportedMajors`
6. since `latestStable` is used as the version to build against,
   a few _source_ incompatibilities might appear once `latestStable` is updated, even when the plugin was _binary_ compatible with the new IDE version.

## PRs & releases

Each regular (non-hotfix, non-release, non-backport) PR is ultimately merged to `develop`. <br/>
Stacked PRs (Y -> X -> `develop`) must never be merged until their base is finally changed to `develop`.
They must instead be retargeted to its base's base once their base branch is merged itself (Y -> X -> `develop` => X gets merged => Y -> `develop`).

To create a release:
* make sure [CHANGE-NOTES.html](CHANGE-NOTES.html) are updated
* open PR from `develop` to `master`

Once the release PR is merged, `master` is built. <br/>
After manual approval, the `master` build:
* pushes a tag (`v<version>`) back to the repository
* creates a [GitHub release](https://github.com/VirtusLab/git-machete-intellij-plugin/releases)
* **publishes the plugin to JetBrains marketplace**

Backport PRs are recognized by the `backport/*` branch name.
They must have `develop` as its base.

Hotfix PRs (`hotfix/*` branch name) are PRs to `master` but NOT from `develop` commit.
They always introduce a non-linear history on `develop` since after a hotfix PR is merged,
a backport PR from hotfixed `master` to `develop` is opened, and it cannot be fast-forward merged. <br/>
The alternative that would preserve linear history is to rebase the `develop` history
since the latest release over the hotfixed `master`.
This would mean, however, that the commits referenced from PRs previously merged to `develop` will no longer be part of `develop`'s history,
which is rather unacceptable.
